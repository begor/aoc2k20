# First part
# Before you leave, the Elves in accounting just need you to fix your expense report (your puzzle input); apparently, something isn't quite adding up.
# Specifically, they need you to find the two entries that sum to 2020 and then multiply those two numbers together.
# For example, suppose your expense report contained the following:
# 1721
# 979
# 366
# 299
# 675
# 1456
# In this list, the two entries that sum to 2020 are 1721 and 299. Multiplying them together produces 1721 * 299 = 514579, so the correct answer is 514579.
# Of course, your expense report is much larger. Find the two entries that sum to 2020; what do you get if you multiply them together?

# Second part:
# The Elves in accounting are thankful for your help; one of them even offers you a starfish coin they had left over from a past vacation. They offer you a second one if you can find three numbers in your expense report that meet the same criteria.
# Using the above example again, the three entries that sum to 2020 are 979, 366, and 675. Multiplying them together produces the answer, 241861950.
# In your expense report, what is the product of the three entries that sum to 2020?
